# ESC180  
This repository contains labs for U of T Engineering Science's ESC180 (Introduction to Computer Programming) course. The assignments are coded in Python and C. 

## Lab Overview
**Lab 1**  Design a Tic Tac Toe Program in Python that generates & displays the game board and allows two users to play against each other    

**Lab 2**  Design a Tic Tac Toe Program in Python that generates moves automatically, enabling a one player versus computer game    

**Lab 3**  Explore UNIX commands and write an application (i.e., a program) that will open a file, read its contents, modify said contents, and print the result  

**Lab 4**  Part A: Write a counter class in Python as a simple example of a Finite State Machine (FSM) & test it   
Part B: Design a sequence detection FSM in Python that can detect a repeating text sequence in a sentence   

**Lab 5**  Generate Python libraries to simulate Conway's Game of Life   

**Lab 6**  Part A: Program and compile C square root function  
Part B: Simulate Conway's Game of Life from Lab 5   

**Lab 7**  Program a recursive fibonacci program in C which is able to generate the first n numbers or output the nth fibonacci number.  

**Lab 8**  Part A: Program bubblesort algorithm in C and Python   
Part B: Program an algorithm in C which is able to apply Gaussian Elimination to reduce matrices  

**Lab 9**  Implement Link List data structure in C with add, print, delete, insert, concat and sort capabilities 

**Lab 10**  Code up solution to each question in Term Test B in C.
